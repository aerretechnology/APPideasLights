You're not supposed to be here yet.

This is code that was written to accompany a custom-built WiFi controller for 5050SMD LED light strips. 

The Arduino directory contains code to be uplaoded to an ESP8266-12E development board.

The mobile-app directory has an abandoned Objective-C project (temporarily) and a React Native project, which is the current app.

I am writing the Instructable that will accompany these apps, and will release it in Novemeber.

Check back for the Instructable URL then. I'm not providing more information about using this until that's public.

In the meantime, check out this Instructable about making custom PCBs on a CNC router.

If you have a CNC router this will come in handy for making a customer WiFi constroller.

NOTE: Create documentation to list the possible API calls to the ESP
