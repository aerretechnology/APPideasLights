You're not supposed to be here yet.

This is code that was written to accompany a custom-built WiFi controller for 5050SMD LED light strips. 

The Arduino directory contains code to be uploaded to an ESP8266-12E development board.

The mobile-app directory has an abandoned Objective-C project (temporarily) and a React Native project, which is the current app.

I have written a crap-ton of mobile apps, but this is my first in React Native. It is functional, but not written with best practices. A majority of the items on the Issues list are related to that fact. If you are an experienced React Native developer and wouldn't mind offering a few hours to refactor this code before the codebase grows to be large, that would be awesome. Issue #1 is the core of it all.

I am writing the Instructable that will accompany these apps, and will release it in Novemeber. Check back for the Instructable URL then. I'm not providing more information about using this until that's public.

In the meantime, check out this Instructable about making custom PCBs on a CNC router:

If you have a CNC router this will come in handy for making a custom WiFi constroller.

NOTE: Create documentation to list the possible API calls to the ESP
